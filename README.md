## Enrolment Logging

The local plugin Enrolment Logging provides an easy way to track and
monitor course enrolments to whitelisted courses or all courses
whenever a user will be enrolled.

## Installation

Just clone or download the latest version from the master branch to your Moodle installation and walk through the site update process or run the upgrade.php from command line:

    $ php admin/cli/upgrade.php --non-interactive


## Usage

After installation you can enable/disable the enrolment logging and
add courses to a whitelist or just leave the field blank to log
all courses.
